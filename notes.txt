To encounter, 'node-waf' not found error while installing db-mysql, the following solutions have been implemeneted.

sudo npm install -g node-gyp
sudo apt-get install libcurl3-dev

alternatively, just installed
sudo npm install -g mysql
sudo npm install -g node-mysql

remove bind-address form /etc/mysql/my.cnf

we are just using mongodb as of now
apt-get install mongodb
npm install mongodb



===Issues===
1. User must not log in via two tabs or windows
2. Make no. of options 1 after setvote
3. Do superusers have uplaod privilieges?
